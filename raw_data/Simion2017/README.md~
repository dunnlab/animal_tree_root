## Dataset

**alignements_1719genes.tgz**  
This archive contains the 1719 alignments as obtained after our complete dataset building protocol.

**supermatrix_97sp_401632pos_1719genes.fasta**  
this file corresponds to the concatenation of the entire dataset (1719 gene alignements).

**supermatrix_90sp_136618pos_heterop60.puz**  
Dataset after the removal of the 60% most heteropecileous sites.

**supermatrix_90sp_102464pos_heterop70.puz**  
Dataset after the removal of the 70% most heteropecileous sites.

**supermatrix_90sp_268032pos_dayhoff6.phy**  
Dayhoff6 recoding of our dataset (constant sites were removed).
You probably want to remove the first line of this file when using other softwares than PhyloBayes.

**partition_401632pos_1719genes.part**  
Partitionning scheme corresponding to the boundaries of the 1719 genes.

**supermatrix_whelan2015_81006pos_NoDemo.phy**  
Dataset from Whelan et al. 2015 in which demosponges have been removed.

**supermatrix_whelan2015_81006pos_NoDemoCalcHomo.phy**  
Dataset from Whelan et al. 2015 in which all sponges except hexactinellides have been removed.

**partition_whelan2015_81006pos.part**  
Partitionning scheme corresponding to the boundaries of the 251 genes from Whelan et al. 2015.

## Softwares

**utilities_src.tgz**  
These are the sources of the C programs used in our dataset assembly procedure.
Please note that the "De-Cross-Contamination" (DCC) step of our procedure has been re-worked 
as a dedicated software (named "CroCo") currently under final development and that will be published elsewhere.

## Information

**choanoflagellate_names.xls**  
This table contains the correspondance between old names used for choanoflagellate data and their recently published valid names
([Carr et al. 2016](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790316302743)).
While recently published valid names are used in our article, we make this table available for clarity.
