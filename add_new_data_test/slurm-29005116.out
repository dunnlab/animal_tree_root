augustus/3.4.0 : If you see errors about not being able to write to an augustus directory, see 'module help augustus/3.4.0'
Nearly all CRAN and BioConductor packages are installed and available by
loading the module R_packages/4.1.1 
The environment variable BUSCO_LINEAGE_SETS is set to a directory containing
BUSCO v5 lineage sets.  Use with the -l option, for example:
    run_BUSCO.py -l $BUSCO_LINEAGE_SETS/fungi_odb10 ...
A list of available lineage sets is provided via 'module help BUSCO/5.3.1'
----
If you see this error from BUSCO:
    Error: Cannot write to Augustus directory, please make sure you have write permissions to <directory>
then you need to create a local copy of the config directory from the augustus
module with 'source $AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_COPY'.  See 'module help augustus/3.4.0'
diamond_databases/latest : for available prebuilt databases, see 'module help diamond_databases/latest'
augustus/3.3.3-CGP : If you see errors about not being able to write to an augustus directory, see 'module help augustus/3.3.3-CGP'
